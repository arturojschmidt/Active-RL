X - Difference Active / Non-active reinforcement learning
X - Difference model-based / model-free
X - Relationship MDP / reinforcement learning


Model-Free:
	X - Experiment with different values for exploration & exploitation & describe effect on outcome (if any)
	X - Describe when to stop learning process
	X - Print the utility value for each state/action/state triplet


Model-Based:
	X - Experiment with different values for exploration & exploitation & describe effect on outcome (if any)
	X - Describe when to stop learning process
	X - Experiment with different discount values & describe effect on policy
	X - Experiment with different epsilon values & describe effect on policy
	X - Print the transition probabilities for each state/action/state triplet
